HistViz
=======

Project Layout
---------------
* `background.{html,js}` launches graph_test.{html,js} in new tab.
* `graph_test.{html,js}` holds TheJIT force-directed graph code.
* `history_graph.json` is my attempt to have an external graph data file that we could generate from history data and visualize separately.
